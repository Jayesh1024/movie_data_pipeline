4. When parsing, dynamic number of child elements in some divs
Sol: Regex

5. Adjust my code by checking the data quality of the spark dataframes and logs if there is some extraction error from the movie sites

6. Adding data quality checks, and defining quality metrics which will be logged for a data quality dashboard
